### General Description:
Each database includes subjects' age, sex, and education years. Those databases containing cognition data also provide subjects' Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. Databases in the main_result directory encompass all subjects utilized in the study, while those located in the supp_results directory pertain to subjects recorded solely with eyes closed. The databases with the suffix *_cognition* contain cognition data, while the one with the *_total* suffix includes all subjects.
